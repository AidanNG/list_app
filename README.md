# To Do List App
This is a basic list app. It's simple but I wanted a project that I could hopefully grow.

I make a lot of lists in Google docs in order to stay on track with the things I want to get done. Being what it is, it has a lot of limitations.
This project will hopefully solve that problem for me. Any feedback and advice on how to expand is greatly appreciated. My email is in my bio.

To get started, Run the init.py to create the csvs and install packages,

python init.py

and then from there, to use the app,

python main.py

Once everything is runnning, you can use the text boxes to start adding things to the task list.

Inputs:
    -task name
    -due date
    -tag

All three inputs are strings. The tag will help describe the task you want to accomplish. Every unique tag will have its own list for organizational purposes.

Simply populate the text boxes and add to the list with the 'Add New Task' button. 

For removal, simply check the boxes, you want to remove and click the 'Remove Completed Tasks' button
